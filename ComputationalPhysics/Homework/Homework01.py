Part 1: 
    A spaceship travels from Earth in a straight 
    line at relativistic speed v (relative to Earth)
    to another planet x light years away (as seen in 
    in Earth's rest frame). Write a program to ask 
    the user for the value x and the speed v as a 
    fraction of the speed of light c, then:
        1. Remember the speed of light c = 1 light 
        year/year. Use this fact to compute and printout
        the travel time in years in the rest frame 
        of an observer on Earth.
        2. Recal that in the rest frame of the
        spaceship, the distance to the destination
        is REDUCED by Lorentz contraction by a factor
        of Phi = 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2). Use this information
        to compute and print out the travel time in 
        years as seen in rest frame of a passenger 
        on board the ship.
    Use your program to calculate the answers for 
    a planet 10 light years away with v = 0.99c. 
    Make sure that your answer to part (b) makes 
    sense.

Part 2:
    Newman Exercise 2.7 [p. 46]: Teh Catalan numbers 
    C_n are a sequence of integers 1,1,2,5,14,42,132,...
    that play an important role in quantum mechanics
    and the theory of disordered systems. (They were
    central to Eugene Wigner's proof of the so-called
    semicircle law.) They are given by
          C_0 = 1, C_n+1 = (4n+2)/(n+2) * C_n.
    Write a program that prints in increasing order all
    Catalan numbers less than or equal to one billion.
