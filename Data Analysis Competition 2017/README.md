This was the code I wrote for a one-day undergraduate data analysis competition. Here, you will find the practice problems denoted with _pract_. Here, you will also find the code for feature selection: pca.py, k-best feature selection. Also, you will find the models tested and used leveraging the sci-kit learn modules including Naive Bayes, k-neighbors, logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
